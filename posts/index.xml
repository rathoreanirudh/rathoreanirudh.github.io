            <description>This is the second reading of my week. Actually my first in-depth reading. I plan to do research in interpretable machine learning and trying to understand what causes bias to creep into the machine learning models.
In this paper by Murdoch et al., they start by definining interpretability and what it means at different stages of the data science life cycle. According to the paper, in the absence of a well formed definition of interpretability</description>

            <description>This post is for my human centered machine learning class. We are required to read a paper every week and write a summary for it. I am trying to make a habit of writing this blog describing the papers I read.</description>
