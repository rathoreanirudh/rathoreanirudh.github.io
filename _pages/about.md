I am a research-based master's student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, advised by [Prof. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/). My primary research objective is to improve human life by augmenting it with artificial intelligence. Currently, I am working on interpretable machine learning to build a bridge of unwavering trust between humans and these black-box models.

Before joining CU, I was a applied machine learning engineer at VMware Inc., India. I got my B.E. from [Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra](https://bitmesra.ac.in/Show_Department_Section?cid=1&deptid=70) where I was advised by [Dr. Indrajit Mukherjee](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/Display_My_Profile_00983KKj893L?id=m2tn%252fvol1B85vDfjN2ESQL2jSj69d5FPvMAluo16oh8%253d)
