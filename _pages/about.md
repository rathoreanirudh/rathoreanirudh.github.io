I am a research-based master's student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, advised by [Prof. Chenhao Tan](https://chenhaot.com/). My primary research objective is to improve human life by augmenting it with artificial intelligence. Currently, I am working on interpretable machine learning to build a bridge of unwavering trust between humans and these black-box models.
